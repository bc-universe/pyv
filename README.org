# Py-V Assembler

This project was used as a learning task to get more intimate with RISC-V and what an assembler does.
It is by no means complete, does not even have pseudo instructions.

Has the bare minimumm to spit out the same binary for a simple sum calculation in assembly.

#+BEGIN_SRC
python3 main.py ./assembly/sum.S
